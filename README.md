### Repo structure

* `matrix_torch.ipynb`: method used for the final submission. Matrix factorization in PyTorch.
* `grid.py`: contains grid searches and other plots used to find the optimal hyperparameters. It can be run using `python3 grid.py`
* The folder saved_arrays contains some losses and means that were generated during grid searches for reproducibility.
* `matrix_factorization.ipynb`: matrix factorization from scratch.
* `augm_request.ipynb`: Hybrid content-user based collaborative filtering using the augmented dataset generated by `augm_googlebooksapi.py`.
* `user_item_filtering.ipynb`: basic vectorized user-based and item-based collaborative filtering inspired from week 5 exercises.
