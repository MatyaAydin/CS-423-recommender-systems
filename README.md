### Repo structure

* `matrix_torch.ipynb`: method used for the final submission. Matrix factorization in PyTorch.
* `search.py`: contains grid searches and other plots used to find the optimal hyperparameters. It can be run using `python3 grid.py`.
* The folder saved_arrays contains some losses and means that were generated during grid searches for reproducibility.
* The folder other contains the other methods described in the appendix:
    * `matrix_factorization.ipynb`: matrix factorization from scratch.
    * `augm_request.ipynb`: Hybrid content-user based collaborative filtering using the augmented dataset generated by `augm_googlebooksapi.py`.
    * `user_item_filtering.ipynb`: basic vectorized user-based and item-based collaborative filtering inspired from week 5 exercises.
* The folder utils contains scripts that were used to augment books.csv. You can run them using `python3 name.py` to generate them (takes a while).
* The folder plot contains the plot in the report, they have been generated by `search.py`.
* The folder saved_arrays contains the value in the heatmap for reproducibility.
